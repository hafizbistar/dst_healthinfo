================
[h1]Patchlist[/h1]
v1.0 - Released.
v1.1 - Fixed Issues when using it with a Language Pack (tested only on Russian LP). Actually this is a rewrite of most of the script (like 50%-70% was modified). But it should has slightly better performance that it was or none at all.
v1.2 - Fixed clients crashed upon joining a game.
v1.2.1 - Fixed mouse over not showing when equiping on hand slot.
v1.3 - Fixed hover message showing incorrectly for certain specific actions (e.g cooking). Added configuration to select either Value or Percentage or Both. And changed the icon :D
v1.3.1 - Fixed crash due to a missing file (i was testing something, sorry).
v1.4.0 - Added support for controller. Also added option to use different Modes.
v1.4.1 - Fixed crash issues when trying to plant/build something when using Mode A.
v1.4.2 - Add a 'NaN' check before updating health numbers.
v1.4.3 - Optimize the mod (now properly check if the entity actually have health before adding the healthinfo).
v1.4.4 - Fixed issues on v1.4.3. Also removed Modes as it doesn't seems to serve any _real_ benefits.
